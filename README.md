# Welcome
Welcome to the git repository for the Poudre River flow preference and economic impact study, American Whitewater, 2020!

# /flow_pref
This directory contains code to conduct flow preference analyses. Currently, there are two subdirectories that contain subprprocesses of the analysis: 
- /rating-curves: Develop rating relationships between Poudre Rock stage observations and bias-corrected flow simulations
- /survey-analysis: Analyze survey monkey data to assess boater flow preference

# /econ
This directory contains data and code needed to create a RIMS-II input output model that assesses the economic impact of Whitewater Park use to downtown Fort Collins. 

# /data
This directory contains a handful of light data sets used in out analyses. Data include:
- /gauge: Observed historical stream flows at several key gauges along the Poudre River
- /nwm: National Water Model output for specific NHD stream segments corresponding to American Whitewater reaches in the Poudre Canyon
- /survey-monkey: Survey monkey response data
