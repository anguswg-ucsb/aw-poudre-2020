# Data Collection
- Flow preference surveys are designed to gauge user-percieved quality of whitewater conditions as a function of flow.
- Surveys ask respondents to associate a preference ranking with specified flow rates.
- [Graphic illustrating survey question with boxes and check marks]
- Surveys are distributed by Survey Monkey
- As of MM/DD we have recieved N responses

![The survey asks responents to indicate their percieved preference for specific flow rates.](images/survey-schematic.jpg)

# Data Processing
- The data exported from Survey monkey are not optimally formatted for analysis. 
- tidy
- Numericize preference response
```{r}
string_response = c("Acceptable",
                   "Somewhat Acceptable",
                   "Marginal",
                   "Somewhat Unacceptable",
                   "Unacceptable")

numeric_response = c(2,1,0,-1,-2)

conversion_table <- data.frame(string_response,
                               numeric_response)

head(conversion_table, n = 6)
```


- Respondent attributes, such as home address, percieved level of experience,  Respondent attributes:
```{r}
head(respondent.attributes, n = 100)
```
- Flow preference
```{r}
head(flowpref.dat, n = 100)
```



# Data QC
- Screen respondents that may have difficulty assessing flow conditions. 
- The quality of the response is assumed to be a function of historical visitation. Higher visitation frequency exposes the user to a wider range of flows. By directly experiencing flow conditions, less extrapolation is needed
- User extrapolation. If a respondent has not experienced a particular flow condion, they are forced to mentall interpolate or extrapolated beyond their experience. 
- Experience thresholds:
  - reporting confidence
  - Trip frequency

# Visualization
- Flow preference curves, plotting preference score as a function of flow rate
- Need to effectively visualize an ensemble of individual responses. 
- Simply plotting individual responses is messy becuase flow preference varies among respondents
- Calculate the average preference score at each flow rate.
- What about the variability>
- Potential for Conflict Index quantifies the level of disagreement among respondants. 
- Reflect the PCI with marker size

# Analytics
- Metrics are used to quantitatively characterize the shape of flow preference curves.
1. Optimal flow
2. Optimal flow PCI
3. Neutral flow
4. Neutral flow PCI
5. Average PCI
6. Integrated rech preference
7. Slope of the falling limb
