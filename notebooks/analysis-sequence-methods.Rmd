# Data Collection
- Flow preference surveys are designed to gauge user-percieved quality of whitewater conditions as a function of flow on specific river segments.
- The survey ask respondents to rate the acceptabilty of specified flow levels. The prompt as stated in the suvey is:

> With your preferred craft-type in mind, please consider all the flow-dependent characteristics that contribute to a high quality experience (e.g., depth, challenge, safety, availability of surfing or other play areas, aesthetics, and length of run). For comparative purposes, please rate the acceptability of each flow level.

- Respondents ra
- Surveys are distributed by Survey Monkey
- As of MM/DD we have recieved N responses

# Data Processing
- The data exported from Survey Monkey are not optimally formatted for analysis. The raw data must be cleaned and reorganized into a "tidy" format, and flow preference data must be numerically coded. This process is done in `flow_pref/survey-analysis/tidy-response-data.R`.

### Numericize flow preference data
- Preference response data are converted to a numeric variable class, with values ranging from -2 to 2 (Table 1). This allows us to easily quantitatively analyze flow preferences.
```{r, echo= FALSE}
string_response = c("Acceptable",
                   "Somewhat Acceptable",
                   "Marginal",
                   "Somewhat Unacceptable",
                   "Unacceptable")

numeric_response = c(2,1,0,-1,-2)

conversion_table <- data.frame(string_response,
                               numeric_response)


tbl <- knitr::kable(conversion_table,
             caption =  "Table 1. Numeric codes for flow preference responses", 
             col.names = c("Preference rank (character)","Numeric code"),
             row.names = F)

  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(tbl, 
                            bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                            full_width = F,
                            position = "center")
```

### Respondent attributes data
- Respondent attribute data include descriptive characteristics for each respondent. Attributes include a unique ID code, home location data, skill classification, seasonal trip frequency, and confidence assessing flow conditions (Table 2). Several other respondent attributes are also collected, but not shown in Table 2.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

tbl <- knitr::kable(respondent.attributes[1:10,c(1,3,4,5,13,14)],
             caption =  "Table 2. Respondent attributes data",
             row.names = F,
             col.names = c("ID","State","Zip","Skill class","Trip frequency","Reporting confidence")
             )

  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(tbl, 
                            bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                            full_width = F,
                            position = "center")
```
### Flow preference data
- Flow preference data include respondent ID, river segment, flow, and preference rankings (Table 3). This data set can be easily sorted and filtered and respondent attributes can be cross referenced by respondend ID. Preffered craft for the 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

dat <- flowpref.dat %>%
  filter(respondent.id == "11587874606" & segment.name == "Filter Plant") %>%
  select(respondent.id, segment.name, flow, preference, preference.code)

tbl <- knitr::kable(dat[1:10,],
             caption =  "Table 3. Example flow preference data",
             row.names = F,
             col.names = c("ID", "River Segment", "Flow Rate (cfs)", "Preference Ranking (char)", "Preference Ranking (numeric)")
             )

  
  kableExtra::kable_styling(tbl, 
                            bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                            full_width = F,
                            position = "center")
```



# Data QC
- Screen respondents that may have difficulty assessing flow conditions. 
- The quality of the response is assumed to be a function of historical visitation. Higher visitation frequency exposes the user to a wider range of flows. By directly experiencing flow conditions, less extrapolation is needed
- User extrapolation. If a respondent has not experienced a particular flow condion, they are forced to mentall interpolate or extrapolated beyond their experience. 
- Experience thresholds:
  - reporting confidence
  - Trip frequency

# Visualization
- Flow preference curves, plotting preference score as a function of flow rate
- Need to effectively visualize an ensemble of individual responses. 
- Simply plotting individual responses is messy becuase flow preference varies among respondents
- Calculate the average preference score at each flow rate.
- What about the variability>
- Potential for Conflict Index quantifies the level of disagreement among respondants. 
- Reflect the PCI with marker size

# Analytics
- Metrics are used to quantitatively characterize the shape of flow preference curves.
1. Optimal flow
2. Optimal flow PCI
3. Neutral flow
4. Neutral flow PCI
5. Average PCI
6. Integrated rech preference
7. Slope of the falling limb
